# Logistic-Regression-For-Text-Classification
A regularized, logistic regression to classify text documents. The implementation will be in Python, on top of Spark. To handle the large data set that we will be giving you, it is necessary to use Amazon AWS.

The data set consists of around 170,000 text documents and a test/evaluation data set that consists of 18,700 text documents. All but around 6,000 of these text documents are Wikipedia pages; the remaining documents are descriptions of Australian court cases and rulings. At the highest level, your task is to build a classiﬁer that can automatically ﬁgure out whether a text document is an Australian court case.
